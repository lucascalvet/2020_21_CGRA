### Experiments

We managed to observe without any issue all the proposed experiments.

### Exercises

- In the Teapot Exercises we realised the importance of using the right type of variables (uniform, varying, vec4 and vec3) in order to obtain the end result we wanted. We also saw the effect that shaders can have on the MyScene objects.

- In the Water Effect exercises we realised that it is important to maintain the texture coordinates in values between 0.0 and 1.0, mainly when they are affected by the timefactor value. We had some problems darkening the plane in the lighter spots of the water map, but we managed to fix it. In the end we tried to "get rid of" the little "imperfection" when cycling through "repeating textures" but we didn't manage to do it.

Is there any way to solve this? And maybe make the animation "less rough"?
