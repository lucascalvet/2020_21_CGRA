### Experiments

We managed to observe without any issue all the proposed experiments.
We also "discovered" that with the floor texture in diferent "wraps" (Repeat & Mirrored Repeat) we obtained different floor patterns.

### Exercises

- In exercise 1-3 we were able to easily map the texture coordinates to the corresponding shapes. For the object that were used twice (TriangleBig & TriangleSmall) we had to add a new argument with the texture coordinates (an array) to their constructors enabling different textures to equal shapes.
- In exercise 4-7 we had difficulties in Y
