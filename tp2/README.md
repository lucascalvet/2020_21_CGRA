# CGRA 2020/2021

## Group T03G05

## TP 2 Notes

- In group 2 (ex.1) we had difficulties in finding the precise coordinates of each shape of the tangram to form the intended figure.
- In group 3 (ex.2) we had to visualize the cube in 3D in order to choose the right triangles to form it and then the correct transformation to place it on the right spot.
- In group 4 (ex.3) we saw once again that the order of the transformations is very important for the end result. We had some difficulties in defining the right transformations for the faces of the cube but in the end we reached the proposed result.

### Note - "MyQuad"
- We ended up making the "MyQuad" a double sided square for future purposes.
